      ABOUT THIS PROJECT
    </h1>

    <div className={styles.container}>
      <p className={styles.description}>
      Not long ago I started my career as PO in a health tech startup. I knew I didn't want to spend my life working for
      companies which build products that just waste people's precious life time - like mobile games.
      <br />
      Instead, I wanted to help fantastic teams to build great products which have a positive impact on people's livesüê±‚Äçüíª.
      <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
      Turns out, since then I spent most of my time on regulatory issues - either as product guy or regulatory consultant for DiGAs.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
      And that's a problem for anyone who wants to f(o)und a health tech startup: Kicking-off a business in this space is rough. Why? Not only because it's
      hard to find a working business model. But because suddenly so many regulatory requirements apply to you.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
      And the toughest part isn't even to implement these regulatory requriements. But just to understand which of them apply in the first place and
      what stuff like "state of the art transport encryption" (wrapped in complicated lawmaker's language nobody understands) exactly means for implementation (hint: simply enforcing TLS 1.2 or higher is not enough).
      <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
      So, right from the start you üî• hundred thousands of your valuable funding on regulatory consultants, T√úV, maybe even
      legal counsel or technical writers and large parts of your employee's time to become regulatory compliant, sometimes even before having something
      out on the market.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
      Now, this would not be an issue if all the legal requirements would help making your product and processes more safe.
      However the worst part is: A lot of the required documentation and processes is just excessive regulatory frenzy and does not increase you product's security by a
      bit (literally üòÑ). For example, I've never seen any "Datenschutzfolgenabsch√§tzung" that actually led to a new feature being developed, which actually helps making your user's health data more safe.
      <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
      So, to make life a little easier for you I decided to publish all of my practical experience as DiGA consultant
      on this website - for free (yes, free lunches are possible I don't care what some Economists say about this). You're welcome. Hopefully it helps you
      spend more time on what actually matters: Your users.
