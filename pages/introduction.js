      INTRO TO BECOMING A DiGA

        Through DVG the German lawmaker gives you a chance to make your product prescribable by doctors like any other medication and be reimbursed
        by public health insurances. That's great news ðŸŽ‰. For the first time many health tech startups got the chance to build their business
        around a working business model. Because let's be honest: Nobody pays for health apps and selective contracts with health insurances rarely ever
        return enough revenue because insurances' use their bargaining power pretty harsh more often than not.

        Aye, so much for the good part. Because becoming a digital health application (DiGA) also comes at a price. High regulatory demands from many institutions will
        increase product development time (in my experience double it at least), entail lots of documentation requirements and restrict your freedom
        in building a product with great UX and added services that actually helps users.

        Yeh, don't worry. There are more laws which apply to you and more regulation you have to follow. But these four require the largest chunk of work.
        If you decide you want your product to become a DiGA listed with BfArM (the authority which checks whether you actually fulfill all DVG requirements)
        then make sure your product is able to do at least this:
        <br /><br />
        â–º Your product has measurable positive medical effects on people with a certain medical condition (or at least you believe it has) <br />
        â–º The risk entailed by using your product does not cause significant physical or psychological harm (you are of low risk-class, I or IIa according to MDR) <br />
        Basically this means you are MDR compliant and carry a CE certification, which TÃœV (or any other institution like them) will verify<br />
        â–º Your product's effect does NOT rely on added services, like interaction with therapists, coaches, doctors etc. The effect must come from your app itself.<br />
        There is a grey area, which I describe in <a
