        Through DVG the German lawmaker gives you a chance to make your product prescribable by doctors like any other medication and be reimbursed
        by public health insurances. That's great news ðŸŽ‰. Because for the first time many health tech startups got the chance to build their business
        around a working business model. Because truth is: Nobody pays for health apps and selective contracts with health insurances rarely ever
        bring enough revenue because of the insurances' bargaining power.

        <li>â†’ be a medical product (which in turn requires you to be MDR compliant / CE certified) of risk class I or IIa </li>

        </ul>
